The model is loaded from a JSON file hosted on Teachable Machine's servers. When the user clicks the "Start" button, the webpage requests permission to access the user's webcam. Once permission is granted, the webpage displays a live video feed from the webcam. The webpage then runs the video feed through the machine learning model to detect the number of people in the current frame. The results are displayed below the video feed.
